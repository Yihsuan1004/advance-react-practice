### Container components from presentational components

Separating container components from presentational components is a popular React programming pattern.

If a component has to have state, make calculations based on props, or manage any other complex logic, then that component shouldn’t also have to render HTML-like JSX.

The functional part of a component (state, calculations, etc.) can be separated into a 

***container component*.**
